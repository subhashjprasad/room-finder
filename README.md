This is my personal portfolio. It is coded in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It also uses ThreeJS, NodeJS, React Three Fiber, Rapier, and Vite, as well as Vercel for web hosting. I created the models in Blender.

It's designed in the format of a game, where the user plays as a little dinosaur and (ideally) goes around to different landmarks that represent accomplishments of mine. Obviously, this is still a major work in progress :)
